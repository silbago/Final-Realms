Silbago September 2011: Writing about directory structure here.

Here we have the basic commands for the mud, not slice, berserk or those
fighting commands. Though we have 'kill' here. Most importantly we have
the immortal administration commands. Within we also have security and
access privileges to these commands. Determined by directory name, simply.

Here' goes the standard directories:
  - handler/         Contains shared objects.
  - onetime/         Specialized interactive commands.

Commands reside in sub directories named after usergroups, you can nest
with several usergroups using letter + as seperator. A directory not
containing name of a usergroup is not home for commands.
You can abuse this any way you like, check below for tricks.
Please note that the letter + is illegal in usergroup namespace.

Exceptions:
  - everyone/        No security, anything can use these commands.
  - players/         We allow immortals to use these commands.

Examples:
   - creators/       Any member of this usergroup can use command.
   - demis/          As with 'creators', commands for demigods ONLY.

For multiple usergroups, by _ underscore seperation:
   - demis+gods/     Member of any of these two usergroups.
   - gods+demis/     Silly trick to make same as above but new dir.
   - demis+gods+/    Silly trick to have a double set, but works.
   - +++demis+BAH/   BAH not a usergroup obviously, works for demis

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Legacy directories (will be phased out):
  - alchemist/       For 'lords'
  - builder/         For 'creators'
  - demi/            For 'lords'
  - god/             For 'lords'
  - living/          For anyone and anything
  - mortal/          For interactive's
  - patron/          For 'patrons'
  - thane/           For 'masters'
